## Program functions
1. User availability check
2. If the user is not creating a user
3. Exiting the program by entering a letter "q"

A program where you need to register and check if a user is in the system.
## Testing the program
Testing 1 user input. The user enters his email. If it is in the system, a message will be displayed. 
If not, then the user registers in the system. There is no check for a correctly written email.
```python
command = input("Enter your email: ")
```
For example, a user __Diana__ with an email __dfprivet@gmail.com__ has already been registered.
